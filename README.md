# Othello/Reversi Prototype

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to expand my knowledge and abilities to code. I believe this is an important step to continue my pathway in Computer Science as I will gain actual experience in programming an executable. 

## Goal 
I am aiming to create a fully executable python program by the end of June. If possible, I will implement as many functional systems as possible from the following: GUI, PVM , PVP, and satisfying visual graphics.

## Tech used
- Laptop
- PC
- Pygame (?)
